    <h3>Cooks in a Kitchen: A DBC Recipe for Success</h3>
    <h4>June 14th, 2015</h4>
    <section>
    <p>
      Based on the video and the first week's lessons I've really begun to understand how DBC is not, as Shereef puts it, a "costumer-focused product", but rather a communal kitchen of learning. Admittedly it feels weird to be told only snippets of information about the subject matter, such as a new terminal command, and then told to go Google around for more information on the matter. That sort of teaching style is new to me; I'm used to being able to have all of the information that is needed to understand the subject matter presented in the textbook and in the readings - essentially, within the scope of the materials that the professor provides. This sort of learning where you have to hunt for information outside of the curriculum in order to complete the coursework is much more engaging and probably much more productive. Research has shown time and again that the more you actively interact with your learning the more you learn. The fact that we have to go out and hunt around the web to find various sources of information to piece together how everything works means that we're interacting with the material in a much more dynamic way, which will embed what we learn deeper into our memory banks. Personally I am used to spending hours Googling around to find the answer to various subjects, so I'm comfortable with my web skills, which helps this kind of learning. However, I also think that it presupposes that all of the information needed will be on the web. It also assumes that the information you find will be accurate. Although I'm sure in most cases, especially for introductory programming, the resources online will be correct, a student could end up using a site where the author has outdated or even misinformation. Textbooks feel like they have a certain air of authority so you don't need to worry about possibly getting wrong information. However, that only really helps if you're trying to take a test and regurgitate information. Since we're not trying to get good grades but instead actually understand the coursework, having a bit of misinformation could even be beneficial, because then we need to work out what's wrong and how to fix it.

        I've always been the kind of student who felt like everyone in my class was "in it together", much like how Shereef describes DBC as being a kitchen full of cooks working towards a common goal. I always try to share my best sources and material with everyone else. This was especially true when I was studying Japanese at UCLA - I would always do my best to help other students when they would fall behind in class, and in turn, they would help me when I would struggle. That camaraderie is the kind of learning environment I thrive in and am looking forward to experiencing at DBC. I know what it's like to feel absolutely lost in a subject and think that everyone else in the class understands it but you. Although I was top of my class during my first year of Japanese at UCLA, in the second year I fell to the absolute bottom. I still remember literally crying in the back of the classroom because I would walk into class and not understand a single thing that was said. It was so painful that Japanese quickly went from my favorite class to my most dreaded. I thought I would give up on it but I had already signed up to study abroad in Japan in the fall. It was only after I went to Japan and fully immersed myself in the culture that I was able to emerge proficient in Japanese and much more engaged than ever. I know that throughout every step of my journey in DBC I will feel like I did that second year of Japanese - completely, hopelessly lost. But I'll also know that by immersing myself like this, I will be able to overcome that feeling, and with the help of my cohort, be able to grasp concepts and see myself succeed in ways that I never would think possible.

      I think I am most nervous about Phase 0, as I am balancing a full-time job with DBC. It's difficult to have various commitments like this, but it was the only way that I could support myself financially. I'm looking forward to leaving my job in the beginning of August so I can fully commit to learning code. I'm certainly afraid of being in the 5% that ends up being removed from DBC, but when that fear strikes, I just look up above my desk at my plaques. I was valedictorian in junior high, high school, and had a double major at UCLA. I was always great at learning and I love computers. I'm super passionate about learning code and all the possibilities that it opens up. It's something that I've always wanted to learn how to do and now I'm learning it. It will be hard to bury myself in just code for 19 weeks and avoid other commitments because I do like to be a well-rounded person with an active social life, but I've also made a commitment to my future self that I will do this and succeed. I feel like I'm starving and I just finally sat down at an all-you-can-eat buffet. Time to dig in.
