   Enumerables inn Ruby are a way of going through a set of data one value at a time. The <code>Enumerable</code> class has an element called <code>find_all</code> that I believe exemplifies not only what an enumerable does but also a core tennant of Ruby theory.
   </p>
   <p>
   According to the Ruby Docs: <em><code>Enumerables#find_all</code> returns an array containing all elements of of <code>enum</code>(that is, the thing being operated on) for which the given <code>block</code> returns a true value.</em> Basically what that means is that you are able to give <code>find_all</code> a set of requirements inside of the block and have it return an array of everything that meets that requierment. For example, take a look at the following expression:
   <pre><code>["red", "white", "blue", "gold", "silver"].find_all {|i| i.size > 4}   #=> ["white", "silver"]</code></pre>
   This piece of code will return an array that contains the strings "white" and "silver" because both of those words have a size greater than 4. This is but a simple example of how useful find_all can be.
   </p>
   <p>
    Furthermore, the <code>find_all</code> method actually has a counterpart - <code>reject</code>. <code>reject</code> does the exact same thing as <code>find_all</code> except instead of returning an array of values returned a true value, it returns an array for all values that returned a <em>false</em> value. If we use the same array as before but change the method, we would see:
    <pre><code>["red", "white", "blue", "gold", "silver"].reject {|i| i.size > 4}   #=> ["red", "blue", "gold"]</code></pre>
   </p>
   <p>One of my favorite things about <code>Enumerables#find_all</code> and <code>Enumerables#reject</code> is that they does exactly what they say they will do - they either find all instances or reject all instances that meet your requirements. One of Ruby's greatest strengths as a coding language is that the methods do what you think they would do. You don't have to guess what <code>find_all</code> and <code>reject</code> are going to do; they are highly intuitive. These are wonderful methods to represent Ruby.
