   So far pairing with other people has been enlightening, to say the least. I've been fortunate enough to pair with a variety of types of people, which has really taught me a lot about the way different people pair program at this stage in our learning. The most frustrating or challenging thing for me was working with people who were too quiet and didn't talk through their thought process. That said, if you're stuck on a problem and are trying to think about the solution, sometimes a little quiet thinking time is what both parties need. I don't like how you can sometimes feel pressured to arrive at the solution quickly with your partner. You don't want to make your partner wait as you think, but at the same time, if you're both talking, it can be hard to get the thinking done that you need to.

   The most rewarding types of pair sessions have been those where not only did we solve the code but the two of us were also able to shoot the breeze and become friends. I realize that even if someone is a great coder and can convey that well enough, if you don't get along on a personal level, it naturally makes pairing a lot tougher. The social rules of the ways we interact with other people dictates that when a friend gives you advice you don't get defensive, or if your friend makes a mistake you don't get as upset as you would if a stranger did. Pair programming is very personal and I can see now why tech companies often have numerous interviews where you have to meet every member of the team to see if you are a cultural fit. You could be a programming wiz but if you're going to be unpleasant to work with then you are not going to get the job.

   The feedback, to be honest, hasn't been particularly helpful. I think one issue that DBC's feedback prompt has is that it really forces you to come up with at least one piece of actionable criticism. There is no way not to give feedback without actionable criticism, because one of the things you are graded on in your metafeedback is your feedback's actionability. In order to create feedback in the manner that we're supposed to I sometimes find myself distracted from the coding task at hand as I try to analyze my partner and form thoughts on what sort of feedback to provide later. I think requiring constructive feedback isn't a good idea because it can force people to create criticisms where there are none. If you receive feedback that you were too quiet or too talkative, when really you weren't and that was just your partner writing something to fulfill the requirement, then that's actually counterproductive, as you may act to remedy something that was never an issue to begin with.

    The feedback I have received so far has seemed fairly run-of-the-mill. All of the feedback I received has been relatively what I expected to hear. However, I think this is to be expected - as we are all beginners, most of the challenges at hand haven't been <em>too</em> difficult to complete. Because of this, most people in the pairing sessions tend to seem able and confident in their programming abilities. It's also easy for people to look at the challenge ahead of time and come to the pairing session with a couple of ideas - in fact, I find that to be a much better way, because sometimes for the challenges you spend the first 15 minutes just sitting there, thinking how to begin. I believe that when we are actually at DBC and have to begin really puzzling coding challenges as soon as they are presented to us, that we'll then start to see where people's true strengths and weaknesses lie, and the feedback will then reflect our actual performance and be much more actionable.
