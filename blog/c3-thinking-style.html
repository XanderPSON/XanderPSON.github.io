    <h1>Thinking Styles: I Think Not</h1>
    <h2>Yet another psychology myth that won't die</h2>

      <p>
      Confession time: The biggest thing I dislike about DBC so far has been the well-meaning but misguided effort to push the concept of "thinking styles" or "learning styles" on us students. In this post I will explain why I disregard these online tests but instead what I will be doing to achieve an even better result than what DBC is aiming for.
      </p>
      <p>
      DBC is a big proponent of having its students take online personality tests to determine what is their optimal learning style. The one we were required to complete before beginning Phase 0 was essentially a VAK test. VAK stands for visual, auditory, and kinesthetic, which represents the three different mediums that this learning style hypothesizes exists. The hypothesis says that each person has a different learning style that is optimal for them. For example. this would mean that there would be some people who would learn history better either by hearing about it from a lecture, by reading about it in a book and looking at graphics, or by somehow kinesthetically experiencing it, perhaps through mini reenactments of the material.
      <br>
      Unfortunately, this learning style theory, as the same with other learning style theories, is NOT supported by science. It is widely considered to be a psychological MYTH, just as is the belief that there are "left-brained" and "right-brained" people, or that we only use 10% of our brain. This theory unfortunately gained wide acknowledgement, and now the scientific community is trying to reign it in, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce31WjiVcY0">TED talks</a> to <a href="http://www.skeptic.com/insight/the-myth-of-learning-styles/">insightful blog posts</a> from the website Skeptic.com (which boasts members like Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse Tyson). As a Cogntiive Science major at UCLA who did research on memory and learning and who tries to stay on top of the newest scientific literature, this is an effort that I'm personally attached to.
      <br>
      If you think about it, this idea of learning styles obviously doesn't make sense. You can't learn how to drive a car just by listening to someone tell you how to and not actually getting behind the wheel yourself. And you can't study for your philosophy exam through kinesthetic interpretive dance. In reality, how well you learn something does not depend on your learning style, but the style in which that material is presented. In other words, you need to match the presentation style to the content to get the best results.
      <br>
      That's what I plan on doing during my time at DBC - I will be matching the way I study not to some false idea of how <strong>I</strong> think I learn, but how that material should be best learnt.
      </p>
      <p>Now, admittedly I can only really attempt a take down of the concept of optimal learning styles, as that's what most of the scientific literature out there has focused on debunking. I have not heard much noise about debunking theories of thinking styles, but I don't believe that's due to their veracity, but to the concept of different thinking styles not being mainstream enough yet to warrant serious scientific research to be done to support or rebuke these claims. Therefore, for the purpose of these cultural blog posts, I will entice the idea of different thinking styles, but will approach it with the same scrutiny as I do the concept of learning styles.
