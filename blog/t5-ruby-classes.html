   Classes allow you to create real-world objects. For my example, though, I am going to make something that is slightly geeky - a real-world object of an RPG class type: the Rogue.
   <pre><code>
    > class Rogue
    > attr_reader :name, :weapon, :level, :str, :dex
    >
    > def initialize(name, weapon)
    >   @name = name
    >   @weapon = weapon
    >   @level = 1
    >   @str = 10
    >   @dex = 15
    > end
    >
    > def attack
    >   if @str < 30
    >   puts rand(1..6)
    >   else
    >   puts rand(1..6) + rand(1..6)
    >   end
    >   if @weapon == "bow"
    >   puts "You deal extra damage of #{rand(1..6)} with your bow!"
    >   end
    > end
    >
    > def saving_roll
    >   if @dex < 20
    >   puts rand(1..6) + rand(1..6)
    >   else
    >   puts rand(1..6) + rand(1..6) + rand(1..6)
    >   end
    > end
    >
    > def level_up
    >   @level += 1
    >   @str += 1
    >   @dex += 2
    > end
    >
    > end 
   </code></pre>
   </p>

    Okay, so let's unpack this. What's going on here? Well on the first line we've created an object of class called Rogue. On the second line we use <code>attr_reader</code> to generate a list of what are called <em>instance variables</em>. An instance variable is a variable is denoted by the @ sign in front of it. An instance variable is a variable that is accessible to all methods within that instance of that object. So, for example, if we create a Rogue named Shadow and his @dex is equal to 15, then all throughout the different methods we call on Shadow, his @dex will remain the same, and we don't need to generate that info every time. Neato! <code>attr_reader</code> also allows us to call the name of that value on Shadow and see what it currently is. So for example, if we want to see Shadow's level, we can just enter Shadow.level and it will print his current @level.
   </p>
   <p>
     The next thing we write is our <code>def initialize</code> section. Here you can see that we allow the user to generate a new Rogue with a name (@name) and a weapon (@weapon). The level (@level) of a new Rogue is automatically set to 1, the strength (@str) at 10, and the dexterity (@dex) at 15. All these
   </p>
   <p>
     Next we define the instance method <code>#attack</code>. This is going to generate an integer for us that we can use as our attack power in our adventure. A low level Rogue is not very powerful and therefore will only be rolling one die (rand(0..6)) until their strength is at least above 30, at which point they will then roll two dice for their damage output. Rogues are proficient with bows, so if you happened to have initialized your Rogue with a weapon "bow", then you get an extra damage roll too! We have a similar instance method next called <code>#saving_roll</code> that uses the Rogue's current dexterity to generate more dice rolls.
   </p>
   <p>
     Lastly, we have the instance method <code>#level_up</code> that increases the Rogue's level and all of his stats. Because his stats are all instance variables the new values will be saved and be used across all of the other methods for this Rogue.
   </p>
   <p>
     Code using this new class might look something like this:
     <pre><code>
     my_rogue = Rogue.new("Shadow", "stiletto") #generates a new Level 1 Rogue called Shadow equipped with a stiletto dagger
     my_rogue.attack #outputs a random number between 1-6
     my_rogue.saving_roll #outputs a random number between 2-12
     my_rogue.level #outputs "1"
     my_rogue.level_up #increases stats
     my_rogue.level #outputs "2"
     </code></pre>
   </p>
   <p>
     Although this example was a little less "realistic" than it could have been, I hope it clearly demonstrates the flexability of generating a new class. You could easily generate a class of <code>dog</code> instead of <code>Rogue</code> and instead of <code>weapon</code> pass the dog their <code>favorite_toy</code>. You really have  complete flexibility to generate whatever you want!
