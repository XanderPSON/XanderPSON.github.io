 <h1>Questions</h1> 
 <h2>The Art of Asking</h2>
 <h3>August 16th, 2015</h3>
    <section>
    <p>
    The ability to ask a good question is of paramount importance in the coding world. Everyone is "in it together" as it were and are generally willing to help each other out when questions are asked. That said, people are only willing to offer an answer if your question is inviting. A question that is confusing, off-putting, poorly written, or in some way difficult to understand or unpleasant to read, it will go unanswered.

    Reflecting upon my own questions, I think I actually do pretty well in this area. Studying programming is like studying a language, and thankfully I have extensive experience studying a foreign language. Japanese was one of my majors at univeristy; after I graduated I went to Japan and spent 3 years as an English teacher there. There are lots of Japanese language learners, all of whom are usually very willing to help each other out with questions. Those who were too prideful to ask had the slowest improvements. Those who were too haughty in their explanations, such as answering with "Oh, you don't even know THAT?", were quickly learned to be avoided. I've known types of people like that and it's exteremly off-putting. Since I tend to hold people's opinion of me in higher regard than I should, I've adapted to not asking or responding to questions in a rude manner. I also think the Japanese sensibilities that I picked up while living there help with my conflict-avoiding approach to asking questions.

    An area that I can improve on, however, is clarity. I think I would have asked my questions like "Java: How do you create a variable" because that seems more clean and searchable to me. However, I can see why "How do you create a variable in Java?" may be a better way to phrase it. This way is natural English and how easy a question is able to be quickly read and understood will increase the probability that people will respond if they can. We can leave the organizing and searching to the search engine - focus on getting your question read and answered.

    I also think I can improve my question asking by including more examples and becoming more comfortable with the use of foobar. While I understand that foobar is simply a placeholder I feel like a lot of people respond to questions with the most basic of syntax using foobar, which can sometimes be difficult to understand. I love real-world examples; instead of saying "Create Class foo with class variable bar" I'd asy "Create Class ticket with class variable price". That is much easier to me to read and understand, and when I can, I try to respond in that way. However, the vast majority of people on Stack Overflow only use foobar and basic syntax; therefore, I need to become more comfortable with reading and comprehending it, as I can't always rely on a real-world example to be given.

    Going into DBC this week I have a lot of questions; namely, "Am I underprepared?" I know it's not a competition between each student to see who knows how much, but I do feel that since I had to work full time during Phase 0, I wasn't able to devote as much extra time to going down rabbit holes and learning and practicing code as others were. I fully understood all of the main challenges though and feel comfortable with my core ability - it's all the extra stuff that I feel like I'll be playing catch up on. Hopefully DBC recognizes that a lot of people in Phase 0 work (at least, I think it wasn't just me...) and it won't really matter that other people know some more code than I do. However, when I have questions, at least I'll know how to ask them :)
