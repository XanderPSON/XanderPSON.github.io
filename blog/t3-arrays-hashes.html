 <h1>Scrambled Arrays or Hash-browns?</h1>

      Arrays and hashes in Ruby are both ways of storing data. Although there are similarities between the two, the differences between them make their appropriate usage quite different. Here's my attempt at explaining the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      For starters, lets think of an array a row of banker boxes (you know, those boxes you can get from Staples that people use to move; think of the stereotypical box used in TV shows when someone is fired from their office and they're carriyng all of their belongings in a box). Each of these boxes has a label stuck on top of the lid. The first box has a number of "0", the second "1", and third "2", and so on (so the number of the box is equal to n-1). You can put anything you want inside of that box. You can put an integer, a float, a string, or even another array! When you want to use one of those boxes, you have to call the command array[box number]. You can of course add and remove boxes to the array. This is basically how an array works.<br>

      Example: Returning test_array[2] would return whatever was inside of test_array in the third slot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's look at hashes. Let's imagine again our row of banker boxes, only this time they don't have numerical labels from 0 onwards on the top of the box. Instead, YOU must now create the label for each box. This label is called a "key", and the content inside the box is called a "value", and they make up the key-value relationship that is the defining aspect of hashes.<br>

      Example: Assign hashes like
      <code>test_hash = {key: "value"}</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Assigning your own keys opens up a lot of new possibilities that weren't possible with arrays before. For example, let's say that you want to go through your Steam game library and want to give each game you own a rating of 1-10. With hashes you can set the key to be the title of each game (like "Borderlands") and then set the value of the game to be the rating (like "8"). So imagine now that you have a banker box with the lable "Borderlands 2" on it and inside is the rating "8". I can now do all sorts of fun things, like create a list of only games that have a rating of 7 or above, and have Borderlands 2 be on that list.<br>

      Example:
      <code>
      games = {
      Borderlands: 8
      Batman Arkham City: 9
      Call of Duty: 3
      }

      games.each_value do |x|
        if x > 7
          puts x
        end
      end
    </code>
