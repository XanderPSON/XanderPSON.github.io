    <h1>Cyberbullying</h1>
    <h2>What the Tech Industry is (and isn't) doing about it</h2>

      Growing up in the 90s and early 00s I was bullied my fair share, just like most kids were. Antibullying efforts were mainly targeted at stopping physical violence. When people my generation and older think of bullying, we tend to think of a big thug of a student beating up on a smaller, weaker student. Some of these bullying tactics even had names, like the swirly, purple nurple, or the wedgie. And we've all watched countless times in movies where students beat up other students for their lunch money or cram them into their lockers. But now there's a new form of bullying - cyberbullying - and the very people who enabled this form of bullying to exist aren't doing anything to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
      As someone who has worked with elementary and junior high school students for over 13 years (10 years as a summer camp counselor and 3 years as a full-time teacher), cyberbullying is an issue that is close to my heart. When I was a teacher in Japan I knew that some of my students were cyberbullied, and I felt completely helpless to prevent it. Students in Japan are generally bullied both in person and online through exclusionary tactics; groups of students would all make LINE Groups and invite all of their classmates to the group except for the person they wanted to bully. They'd then drop hints to the bullied kid that everyone else was talking about them behind their back in a group they weren't welcome to be a part of. Western cyberbullying tends to be much more direct, with students trash talking each other directly, either through texts or through SNS. Most of the issue lies in SNS, becacuse then the bullying is publically displayed for all to see.

      So first off, is cyberbullying really that big of an issue? In doing reserach for this blog post I was astounded to see the data. According to <a href="www.internetsafety101.org/cyberbullyingstatistics.html">www.internetysafety101.org</a>:
      <ul>
      <li>95% of social-media using teens have witnessed cruel behaviro on SNS say they have seen others ignore the behavior.</li>
      <li>66% of teens who have witnessed online cruelty have also witnessed others joining; 21% say they have also joined in the harassment.</li>
      <li>90% of social media-using teens who have witnessed online cruelty say they have ignored mean behavior on social media.</li>
      <li>Only 7% of U.S. parents are worried about cyberbullying, even though 33% of teenagers have been victims of cyberbullying.</li>
      <li>43% of teens aged 13 to 17 report that they have experienced some sort of cyberbulying in the past year.</li>
      <li>81% of youth agree that bullying online is easier to get away with than bullying in person.</li>
      </ul>
      So what does all this mean? To summarize, it means that cyberbullying is extremely prevalent (43% of teens report being cyberbullied in the past yer), it's exteremly visible to teens (95% of teens have witnessed it), it's not on parents' list of worries (only 7% are worried about it), and even for those that are worried, it's difficult to detect (81% of youth agree it's more difficult to detect). This isn't a good situation to be putting our youth into. So what does the tech industry have to do with it? In my mind, a lot.

      Some generations have been completely left in the dust when it comes to the rapid development and everyday use of technology. Baby Boomers still chicken-peck to type and are generally unfamiliar with SNS. Thankfully, the Gen X / early Millenials that they raised did not have to deal with cyberbullying. However, even those in Gen X (mid-thirties to fourties), while perhaps slightly more used to technology, are still no where near as tech savvy as their teenage sons and daughters. When new SNS technology like Instagram or Snapchat are released, these parents struggle to make sense of what is going on. And it's not only teens that are bullied - Twitter is the source of much online harrassment, but when people try to report online harrassment to police, they just shrug. The people who are in a position of power to help stop harrassment - parents, guardians, school and city officials, and law enforcement - are not educated on the current battlefields of bullying. And it's hard to blame them - with new apps fading in and out of popularity it can be hard to keep up, especially if you're not already a common SNS user. But this is exactly where I think the tech industry that creates these apps can come into play.

      I'd like to see the tech industry take the charge when it comes to cyberbullying awareness and prevention. The people who know how to use their tools best are the ones creating them; those are also the same people who have the resources to allocate to an intracompany Foundation designed to stop abuse on their platforms. I want to make it clear that I'm not advocating putting the responsibility of moderating their platforms on the tech companies - simply that I wish they would recognize the reality of their product's platform and be proactive in trying to help parents and officials understand how to use their platform and what they can do to prevent cyberbullying. Companies could enact more features for users to report cyberbullying and change their policy towards cyberbullying posts. In fact, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/policy-and-product-updates-aimed-at-combating-abuse">Twitter just announced last April both policy and product updates</a> doing exactly such. Tech companies could also create awareness campaigns and instructional videos on how to use their software for parents and officials. A strong partnership between the parents and officials who are most concerned with the software developers who are able to make literal changes to product and policy would be the best panacea for this modern day problem.
      </p>
      <p>
      Currently the field for anti-cyberbullying software and prevention services is an open, if not scarce, market. <a href="http://stopitcyberbully.com/">STOPit</a>, a new service designed to help report cyberbullying, has been making some headlines recently for their efforts to play a big role in this realm. But it's clear that when simply being a new product in a field is headline news, you know that current efforts are dismal. I really hope that DBC's Emotional Intelligence lessons find their way into the tech industry writ large. Just because we are able to create new software and platforms doesn't mean that we should just do so and then try to eschew any moral ownership over how its used. There needs to be a stronger dialogue in the tech industry about recognizing how our apps can be used for harm and what steps we can do to help prevent that from happening. I know that for whatever app I originate and create in the future I will be as equally invested in my users' experience and safety with the app as I will be with the technical feats of the app itself. I hope that all tech companies and start to become this self-aware.
