 <h2>How to Deal With Conflict</h2>
 <h3>August 9th, 2015</h3>

    When I saw that this challenge was asking us to write about a challenge we had recently faced, my very first thought was of an issue that my former supervisor and I encountered about two years ago at my former place of work, the Consulate General of Japan in San Francisco. The conflict was about whether or not it was okay for me to act as a tour guide for some visiting Japanese high schoolers. The tour that these kids were going on lasted two weeks and covered three states; I had acted as a tour guide the year prior, right before I began my position at the Consulate, and it was an absolute blast, so when the opportuntiy came around next year, I knew I had to jump on it with both feet. The I had purposefully saved up enough vacation days and cleared my work scheudle for those two weeks so that there wouldbe no conflict. Given that my job at the Japanese Consulate was to promote cross-cultural education through being in charge of the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Program, a program that sends young Westerners to Japan to teach English in Japan's K-12 schools, acting as tour guide / translator / catherder to these Japanese high schoolers visiting America was right up my alley. Even though it was completely exhausting and would use up a full two weeks of my vacation time, I was happy to spend my vacation days on something that fun and worthwile.

    My supervisor, however, didn't see it that way. While reviewing my vacation request she called me into her office to discuss the issue. Because these tours were actually funded by Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) money, the same government branch that funds the Japanese Consulate of which I was employed, she thought it represented a "conflict of interest" to have me working for someone else in MOFA, even if it was just for two weeks on during my own vacation. The position did pay about $2000, so she felt that I was getting a part-time job while working at the Consulate, which would have violated my contract.

    I couldn't wrap my head around why she was so adamant about not letting me go. I felt that me taking two weeks off just to work even <em>more</em> for the Japanese government should have made me some sort of patron saint if anything! The goal of these government-funded tours were perfectly aligned with my own job's goals. On top of all that, the $2000 would have really helped financially, as my position didn't pay well at all, and every month I was strapped for cash. I understood how she could arrive at her decision, but I couldn't disagree with it more strongly. We had always got along perfeclty well up until that moment. It made me feel so terrible to argue with her about this, and made me feel so confused that someone could possible think this way and because of that I wouldn't be able to participate, that as soon as I went home I started to look online for other job postings. I wanted out.

    I ended up going to Panda Express for dinner that night, my go-to "restaurant" when feeling crappy. I began to analyze what happened and how I was feeling. I felt that her denying me the ability to participate in this program missed the larger point of why she and I even work at MOFA, which was to promote Japanese-US relations, in particular through educational exchange. I absolutely loved my time teaching English on the JET Program, and this tour felt like that program but in America and on wheels. It was the tour of America I always wanted to give my students but couldn't. The last time I did it I really bonded with the group of high schoolers that I was tasked with, and I kenw that this time would be no different. Being in a role model positon like this is my life's passion, so when I was told that I couldn't do it for reasons I considered to be well-inteded but misguided, it felt my supervisor was denying me access to feeling that sense of accomplishment one gets when they do something that they truly, truly love.
    </p>

    As she was my supervisor and I need her approval to participate in the program, my chances seemed slim to none. I knew there was nothing I could do to change her mind because to her the issue was very clear - I can't work for MOFA in a different capacity than what I currently hold. There weren't any actions I could take to resolve it other than let her sleep on it and try to raise the issue again after she's had some time to think about it. That next day at work she called me into her office. She took a deep breath and apologized. She said she consulted with her supervisor, who said that it was fine that I go. She still had her reservations, but somehow he must have talked some sense in to her. I was ecstatic! I hurredly got her sign for approval before she could have second thoughts, thanked her graciously, and went back to my desk with a triumphant swagger.

    If I could go back in time to do something differently, knowing then what I know now, I probably would have just lied about what I was going to be doing for my vacation and just avoided the entire mess altogether. That and maybe not have eaten Panda Express. It's hard to say if I would have done anything differently; I'm a fairly conflict-adverse person and even when I do enter a conflict with someone, I'm extremely coolheaded. This instance was the first thing that popped into my head because it's honestly the only time I can think of in recent memory when I got upset with someone else. I'm extremely rational and never lose my temper; I honestly can't remember ever yelling at someone for doing something. That's just not my personality.

    I learned from this experience that sometimes you will have supervisors or other people with positions of power over you who will see something fundamentally different. Sometimes you're just never going to be able to change their mind about something, and the only way you'll get your way is if some external party gets involved. It's important to be able to get attached to the idea of doing something too strongly until you're 100% certain that you're able to do it; I definitely became too invested in the tour before it had even begun. I also learned to really think before disclosing information to your supervisors, because they could approach something entirely differently than you do, and given that they are your boss, it's important to make sure that you're always on their good side.
