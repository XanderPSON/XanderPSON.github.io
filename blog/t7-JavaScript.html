 <h1>Ruby Hashes vs JavaScript Objects</h1> 
 <h2>H v O</h2>
 <h3>August 2nd, 2015</h3>

        Understanding the similarities and differences between Ruby hashes and JavaScript objects can be a little difficult, so in this blog post, I will do my best to offer up a clear explanation for fellow beginning programmers.
        </p>
        <p>
        Let's begin with the similarities. The core idea behind hashes and objects is the same: they both are ways of storing key-value pairs. Both hashes and objects contain variables that the programmer is able to name; those variables then point to another variable that the programmer also sets. Both hashes and objects are instantiated by setting the instance equal to a {}, where the properties lie within the {}. Both hashes and objects can have properties created by using a <code>key: value</code> definition method. Finally, both are able to have their keys called in order to return the key's value.
        </p>
        <p>
        Despite the similarities there are many differences. One difference is that in recent updates to Ruby, hashes can now be organized somewhat like arrays, where before they couldn't. Another difference is in how you reference the keys. For example, with a hash, you could do something like either <code>hash["my_key"]</code> to return the value. With a hash you would do hash.my_key. This leads to another difference; with hashes you can have the key be anything; for example, you could have a key be 5 and the value be "pigs". Just so long as you do not have two keys-value pairs with the same key you can use integers. However, with objects, the key in the key-value pair is considered to be a "property", which is technically a string. Although they are strings you are allowed to ommit the quotations around them. This way you are able to access the keys by using dot notation (such as object.key) without having to put quotations around the key (like object."key").
        </p>
        <p>
        Knowing the proper use and syntax for both hashes and objects is essential for all fledgling programmers!
