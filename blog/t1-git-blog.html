      As a budding software engineer one of the first things you'll need to learn about is version control. Version control is the concept of managing multiple saves to your work. Version control is useful because it allows you to work on features and fixes without worrying that you might irreparably create further issues in the code because you can always reload from a prior version. This allows developers the freedom to experiment with new features on side versions of the project while still maintaining a working master version.

        Git is version control software that you install on your computer that you access through the Terminal. Git allows you to create multiple clones, called "branches", of your master code. On these branches you can experiment with new features, attempt hotfixes, or work on any other coding you wish to do. When you are comfortable that your new code works, you can then merge that code back into the master branch.

        GitHub is a place to host your repositories online. This allows for easy sharing with coworkers and easy access from any computer. The best analogy is to think of GitHub like Dropbox for code. You could put everything onto a USB, but then it makes collaborative efforts much harder. GitHub is great because it allows you to easily clone code on GitHub onto your local computer and fork it into different branches for you to work on. You can then easily reupload your completed code back to GitHub.
