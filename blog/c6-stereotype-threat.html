 <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1> 
 <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>

    Stereotype threat is the situational predicament where individuals feel that they are at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group. This feeling results in those individuals to indeed actually confirm those negative stereotypes by performing worse on the given test, usually as a result of increased stress.

    Fortunately (or unfortunately, as the case may be), as I think about my own life experiences, I cannot think of a strong example when I was subject to stereotype threat. As a white, straight, cis, middle-class, atheist male who grew up in Santa Cruz, California, I've never really been subject to many negative stereotypes in society or the media, and as a result, I don't have many experiences from which to draw upon while in the US. That said, when I lived in Japan for three years teaching English, I was no longer the "default" race, but was now on the fringe and subject to stereotypes and unjust treatment. But did I really suffer while I was there? Or were the stereotypes of white Westerns mostly positive, and instead I was treated better there than back home in the US?

    Overall I have to say that the treatment of white foreigners in Japan fairly positive, but with a few caveats. First is that there exists the idea that foreigners will never be able to speak fluent Japanese; only Japanese can speak fluent Japanese. This often manifests itself in situations where you'll speak with a Japanese native over the phone just fine, but when you meet them in person, they suddenly speak and act differently towards you. Stereotype threat would predict that the assumption that non-native Japanese speakers cannot speak fluent Japanese would influence my ability and make me perform worse. However, I really did not feel such an effect; instead, I felt strongly motivated to crush such stereotypes, and it often made me double my efforts to study and speak eloquently. But perhaps my dedication to blowing through this stereotype comes from the fact that I grew up in a country where the story of my social status that I was told dictated that when you encounter stereotypes the proper thing to do is overcome them; not only that, but that with enough effort, I would be able to overcome any stereotype. I wonder if this gungho attitude is more prevalent in white males in the US than it is in any other racial or gender category.

    One place that I did see a resemblence of stereotype threat in Japan was actually from the Japanese themselves. A stereotype that nearly all Japanese hold is that Japanese people are terrible at English; not because they don't study enough, but because inherently, no Japanese person will ever be able to speak English perfectly. I think this probably is a perceived phenomena that derives itself from the concept that no Westerner will ever be able to master Japanese - there's a notion that persists amongst the Japanese zeitgeist that only native speakers can ever be fluent. You often see that Japanese Teachers of English (JTEs, as they are called) will prompt an English lesson with "Well, Japanese people are terrible at English, but here it goes anyways" or something to a similar affect. When the foreign Assistant Language Teacher (ALT) tries to have a sample English conversation with the JTE in front of the class, the JTE may laugh off their English mistakes as "Well, that's to be expected", or something to a similar affect. I wonder if when my Japanese students would take English tests or speak with me in English if they were afraid of reinforcing that stereotype and thus would significantly underperform.

    Although it is hard for me to say that I have experienced stereotype threat directly, I feel like my time in Japan has at least opened my eyes to the reality. I believe that during my time at DBC I will be able to empathize with my cohort members who feel a sense of stereotype threat and be able to help in any small way that I can.
