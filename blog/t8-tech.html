 <h2>What is Rails?</h2>

        With only one week to go before my in-class portion of DBC begins, I felt it was finally time to answer the nagging question that I've had since before I started Phase 0: "So what is Ruby on Rails?" Over these past 8 weeks we've learned a lot about Ruby, but what makes Ruby on Rails different? Why aren't they the same thing? Why are learning Ruby but not Ruby on Rails from the start?
        </p>
        <p>
        Ruby is a programming language like C++ that uses symbols and keywords to create programs. Ruby is easy to learn because of its terseness and because of how it tries to follow the general flow of a spoken language. With Ruby you are able to make a variety of different applications, such as desktop applications. Knowing Ruby gives you a strong fundamental understanding of programming and is a great introductory language to learn. Okay, so if Ruby is like C++ or other programming languages, then just what the heck is Ruby on Rails??
        </p>
        <p>
        Ruby on Rails can be descibed as a framework, as development tools, or as a software library, just to name a few monikers. What do these all mean? Well, think of Ruby like the videogame Skyrim. Skyrim is easily customizeable - it can be "modded" - to add in new skins and models for characters and environmental items. Players are able to change aspects of the game and then release them to the public. Some modders only change the color of one piece of armor. But then there are modders who will change so many things in the game that it seemingly expands the game like an official Expansion Pack / DLC would, or sometimes it's so different from the original that it creates an entirely new game! Ruby is kind of like a game in the sense it can be modded. It is an open source language, which means that anyone can build mods for it. Rails is a bundle of changes to Ruby that makes it easier to create web applications that run on a web server; basically, it's a full mod that changes the way the "game" is played so much that it has created a new "game".
        </p>
        <p>
        Okay, so Rails is just a modded verison of Ruby. So what can it do? Why use Rails instead of just using Ruby and making the mods youself? Well, the mods are extensive and would be incredibly difficult for the average programmer to code. While I guess it would technically be possible for everyone to learn how to code a web application without Rails, it would be an incredible waste of time. So what does Rails do in particular? Well, it helps you write MVC (Model View Controller) web applications, which is a software architecture that basically divvies up the tasks and logic for different segments of a web application (the database, what the user sees, and the thing that operates on both). Rails is great for rapid application development (RAD) and for Agile development, both of which are different ways of quickly making changes to your product.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ruby is also very "opinionated" software. What this means is that it has a very determined order of where all your files are supposed to go and what they're supposed to be named. If you follow the structure that it expects then it works to your benefit by optimizing its performance and saving you a lot of time. This allows for easy transition between coders working on the same project, because they'll know exactly where to look to find the files they're looking for. This also means that there's less time spent trying to organize everything yourself. By abstracting that task away from the coder Rails is much more faster and efficient.
        </p>                                                              
        <p>
        So to wrap up, Ruby is a programming language, not unlike C++, JavaScript, or Python. You can think of Ruby as the "main game" - your Half-Life 2 or WarCraft 3, if you will. Ruby on Rails is a web application framework - basically a bundle of changes that gives Ruby the power to easily do new tasks. Think of Rails then as the Counter-Strike to Ruby's Half-Life 2 or the DotA to Ruby's WarCraft 3.
