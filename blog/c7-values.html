    <em>Inspiration.</em> This is one of the most important values to me personally. When I was a young kid I used to go to a summer camp near my home. The leader of that camp was a man named Oscar. Oscar was a truly inspirational leader: caring, decisive, charismatic, and good-hearted. The man has been working with young kids all of his life in after school and summer camp programs. He inspired me to become a "professional role model", as the back of the staff t-shirts said. I always wanted one of those t-shirts. When I became old enough I volunteered at that summer camp and then was a staff there for a couple of years (and yes, I did eventually get that shirt!). Ever since then I've always worked with young kids with the goal of being a "professional role model". I think the best kind of role model is one that inspires others. In order to inspire someone they need to respect you, look up to you, and trust you. They need to acknowledge your intelligence, compassion, effectiveness, altruism, and a host of other positive characteristics. The number of people that have truly inspired an individual in his or her life can probably be counted on one hand. Being able to be that source of inspiration for someone is, I think, the most important value I can offer this world.

    The last time someone asked for my advice it pertained to getting ready to move to Japan. For the past 2.5 years I have been in charge of the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Program in the Northen California / Nevada area. I have sent off nearly 300 people to Japan to begin their lives as English teachers in a country more than half have never been to, where only a small percentage of those going can actually communicate in the native Japanese language. I was frequently asked for advice from this last batch of 130 participatns, whom I just sent off this past Saturday, on August 1st, 2015. They would ask me for advice because they knew that I was knowledgeable, respectful, responsible, and reliable. I know this because when they would thank me for my expertise they would also often times praise me for these attributes. I have received comments on my breadth of knowledge on nearly each and every subject they ask me about. I have been told that they feel very safe asking me any question, even if they repeatedly ask stupid questions, because they know that I am respectful and do not get irrated and insult them. They have told me that they respect how I handle and maintain all of their individual requests and make sure each one is completed. And finally, I often hear that my fast response time to their inquiries is very much appreciated; in fact, I've had more than one person email me back, frantically asking if I had read their email or not, because it had been more than a few hours since they originally sent it and I hadn't yet responded!

    These four values - knowledgeable, respectful, responsible, and reliable - are values that I find important. As a matter of fact, the last three were known as the "Three R's" at the summer camp that I attended as a child, and were recited every morning and evening. Their importance has been ingrained in my personality.

    When I think of my values I begin to feel very self-assured. I remember that I have self-worth and that I have become the person that I wanted to be. I believe that being this "professional role model" has become such a part of my personal identity that I do try to live up to those expectations as much as possible every day. If I were to encounter stereotype threat I'm sure that remembering that I'm a compassionate, intelligent leader (and a whole host of other niceities that I can tell myself) would help. However, as I have not particularly felt stereotype threat and do not predict that I will be a large victim of it, it is difficult for me to properly predict this method of prevention / healing.

    Personally, as a gamer, I can never feel too depressed after playing a couple of rounds of a really fun game. Even just watching people play releases endorphines and makes me happy. All we need is a good ol' N64 or Gamecube, 4 controllers, a couple of classic games, and some friends. I know it sounds perhaps childish but it's actually a great therapeutic method. If you think about it, you're essentially completely distracting yourself with another task. You're teleported into a world where there are different laws on gravity and reality. You're suspending your own sadness to enter a world that's fun and enjoyable and surrounded by friends. This is a world where you can easily be in 1st Place, even if back in the real world you were just fired and feel like crap. The little burst of energy and happiness that that game can give you could be enough to reset your feelings and help get you out of whatever rut you may have been put into through stereotype threat and other negative reinforcements you had been suffering through.
